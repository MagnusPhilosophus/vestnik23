The work carried out a physicochemical analysis of porous carbon
material (PCM) obtained from brown coal from the Maikuben basin
(Kazakhstan). PUM was obtained by carbonization and activation in argon
and water vapor. The electrophysical characteristics of the PCM were
determined by measuring the electrical capacitance of the samples in the
temperature range 293‚àí483 K. The resulting product exhibits high
characteristics, including high dielectric permittivity, specific
surface area, and capacity, making it effective for use in
supercapacitors as an electrode material and for hydrogen storage. The
coal carbonization process includes an initial low-temperature (at
180¬∞C, with a heating rate of 10¬∞C/min) treatment of the raw material in
the presence of air for 1 hour, followed by carbonization in an inert
atmosphere at temperatures ranging from 180-900¬∞C with a heating rate of
5¬∞C/min, and steam activation at the maximum temperature for 1 hour of
the coal ground to a 0.1 mm fraction. The material is then extruded into
cylindrical shapes (diameter: 2-3 mm, length: 5-10 mm) using a binder
material: starch - 5\%, sodium hydroxide - 0.5\%, water - 17\% of the
total mass of coal.

{\bfseries Keywords:} porous carbon material (PCM), brown coal,
carbonization, activation, thermal decomposition, activated carbon.

{\bfseries Introduction}. Porous carbon nanomaterials, such as biochar,
graphene, and carbon nanotubes, have a wide range of applications in
heavy metal adsorption, energy storage, and sensor technologies due to
their excellent properties, such as high specific surface area (SSA) and
high electrical conductivity. Various synthesis methods for porous
carbon materials have been developed using a broad spectrum of raw
materials. For instance, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is employed to
produce high-quality graphene from methane. However, these methods are
complex, and the raw materials used are either rare or expensive,
hindering the large-scale production and commercialization of advanced
carbon materials {[}1-5{]}.

Biomass is an exciting raw material for advanced porous carbon
nanomaterials through simple pyrolysis. Typically, the production of
porous carbon nanomaterials from biomass has two main advantages. First,
the cost of producing porous carbon nanomaterials can be significantly
lower. Biomass has diverse sources, ranging from straw, husks, leaves,
peels, to microorganisms and chitin, which are low-cost products of
agriculture, industry, and daily life. Second, it helps mitigate
environmental pollution caused by biomass. Biomass is usually discarded,
leading to environmental pollution, especially a large amount of carbon
dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}) released into the atmosphere, exacerbating
the greenhouse effect. To address the issue of electromagnetic radiation
pollution, a simple method exists for producing porous carbon using coal
processing residues as a carbon source {[}6-14{]}.

The intensification of environmental issues, the need for comprehensive
wastewater treatment, gas emissions purification, and the disposal of
hazardous components necessitate the development of new methods and
approaches for creating industrial adsorbents {[}15{]}. This also
involves a more rational approach to the use of natural resources, the
application of hydrocarbon recovery processes, or the concentration of
rare metals from highly diluted solutions. One optimal solution to these
challenges may be the comprehensive use of high-quality and
cost-effective carbon adsorbents, such as activated carbons {[}16{]}.
Due to their physicochemical properties, carbon adsorbents are unique
and ideal sorption materials that can address a wide range of issues
related to ensuring chemical, biological, and radiation safety for
humans, the environment, and infrastructure. Among all available
adsorbents, activated carbons are the most versatile, capable of
absorbing a wide spectrum of toxicants {[}17-18{]}.

There are several methods for producing porous carbon material and
studying its physicochemical properties. One of the most common methods
is the thermal decomposition of organic substances (pyrolysis) in the
absence of oxygen (or at very low concentrations) followed by an
activation process, which involves treating the carbon structures with
chemical reagents or steam at high temperatures. This increases the
material\textquotesingle s porosity, forming micro-, meso-, and
macropores.

The obtained porous carbon material is subjected to various analytical
methods to study its physicochemical properties. This can include
measuring the porous structure (specific surface area, specific pore
volume, pore size distribution, sorption capacity, etc.), surface
chemical analysis (spectroscopy, chromatography), electrochemical
property studies, and other methods {[}19{]}.

Porous carbon materials can be applied in a wide range of fields,
including supercapacitors, catalysts, water purification, hydrogen
storage, and other areas {[}20{]}. Porous carbon materials (PCM) with a
high specific surface area (up to 1200 m¬≤/g), open slit-type porosity,
high electrical conductivity, chemical stability, and low specific
weight have the potential to significantly improve the specific
characteristics of energy storage devices. PCMs based on coal can be
utilized in micro- and nanoelectronics, particularly as solid-state
electrode materials for supercapacitors, and can be used as energy
storage devices and power supplies for various high-power consumers that
have strict requirements for environmental friendliness, cyclic
resource, and readiness for operation, such as in electric vehicles,
solar panels, and satellites. These materials can store much more energy
than traditional capacitive elements, doing so for extended periods
without charge leakage {[}21{]}.

{\bfseries Materials and Methods.} There are numerous methods for producing
porous carbon materials from various carbon-containing substances. The
main difference between these methods is the aggressive reaction
environment required for the carbonization process, which necessitates
costs for washing and neutralizing the pH, as well as energy
expenditures for drying the products.

The proposed method involves the following stages: thermal treatment of
the raw material in an inert gas atmosphere up to 900¬∫C, followed by
activation of the carbon material.

The main advantages of this method are the use of readily available raw
materials, specifically brown coal from Kazakhstan (Maikuben basin,
Shoptykol deposit, W\_\textsuperscript{daf} -- 12.11\%,
A\_\textsuperscript{daf} -- 23.44\%, and V\_\textsuperscript{daf} --
40.66\%); the use of steam instead of caustic sodium for activation; the
production of a ready-to-use product through extrusion; and the
production of PCM with high dielectric permittivity (Œµ = 1.12√ó10‚Åπ at 483
K), a specific surface area of 348.99 m¬≤/g, specific resistance of 3-4
ohms, and a capacitance of 1.2-1.7 ¬µF.

The electrophysical properties (dielectric permittivity and electrical
resistance) of the obtained samples were measured using an LCR-800
series device (Taiwan) at a working frequency of 1 kHz in dry air under
a thermostat regime with a fixed temperature hold time. The Sawyer-Tower
circuit was used to obtain the relationship between electric induction
(D) and electric field strength (E). Visual observation of the D(E)
hysteresis loops was conducted on an S1-83 oscilloscope with a voltage
divider consisting of 6 MŒ© and 700 kŒ© resistors and a reference
capacitor of 0.15 ¬µF. The generator frequency was 300 Hz. For all
temperature studies, the samples were placed in a furnace, and the
temperature was measured using a chromel-alumel thermocouple connected
to a V2-34 voltmeter with an error of ¬±0.1 mV. The temperature change
rate was approximately 5 K/min. The dielectric permittivity at each
temperature was determined using the formula Œµ = C/C‚ÇÄ, where C‚ÇÄ is the
capacitance of the capacitor without the test substance (air).

The specific resistance and capacitance of the PCM were measured using a
digital multimeter "UT-70 B" (China).

The chemical analysis and surface morphology of the PCM were studied
using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) on a SEM (Quanta 3D
200i) equipped with an EDAX EDS attachment. The excitation electron beam
energy was 15 keV.

The phase composition of the PCM was identified using X-ray diffraction.
The X-ray phase analysis was conducted on a DRON-2 setup. Shooting
conditions: FeKŒ± radiation, U = 28 kV, J = 28 mA.

The adsorption characteristics of the PCM (specific surface area) were
studied using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. Measurements were
conducted on a KATAKON Sorbtometer M device.

\emph{Carbonization and Activation}

Carbonization and activation were carried out in a laboratory
high-temperature rotary furnace BR-12NRT (Figure 1).

The coal underwent an initial low-temperature treatment (at 180¬∞C, with
a heating rate of 10¬∞C/min) in the presence of air for 1 hour, followed
by carbonization in an inert atmosphere at temperatures ranging from
180-900¬∞C with a heating rate of 5¬∞C/min, and steam activation at the
maximum temperature for 1 hour. The coal was ground to a 0.1 mm
fraction, extruded into cylindrical shapes (diameter: 2-3 mm, length:
5-10 mm) using a binder material: starch - 5\%, sodium hydroxide -
0.5\%, water - 17\% of the total mass of coal.

{\bfseries Results and Discussion}. The results of the elemental analysis
of the PCM obtained at 900¬∞C, presented in Table 2, indicate that after
the thermal treatment of the coal, a significant portion of the volatile
components are removed as gaseous products, thereby increasing the
concentration of the mineral constituents.

The analysis of the surface morphology of raw coal revealed a
heterogeneous structure characterized by flake-like inclusions in the
carbon matrix and particles with a plate-stepped shape. The SEM images
show that after thermal activation of the coal, the surface structure
becomes more developed with smaller particle sizes. The specific surface
area and specific pore volume significantly increase compared to the raw
sample-from 5.11 to 348.99 m¬≤/g, approximately 70 times greater due to
high-temperature activation. The SEM images of the PCM show the
formation of fine nano- and macro-particles of silicon on the surface,
with diameters ranging from \textasciitilde50 nm to \textasciitilde1 Œºm.

383-433 K, and semiconductor conductivity at 433-483 K. The bandgap
width at 333-383 K is 1.24 eV, and at 433-483 K, it is 1.84 eV,
classifying it as a narrow-band semiconductor. The dielectric
permittivity values are also low, with the specific surface area of the
adsorbent being 20.95 m¬≤/g. The specific resistance of PCM is higher
than MŒ©, and the PCM does not exhibit capacitance accumulation.

293-353 K, metallic conductivity at 353-403 K, semiconductor again at
403-473 K, and metallic conductivity at 473-483 K. The bandgap width at
293-353 K is 0.79 eV, and at 403-473 K, it is 1.24 eV, classifying it as
a narrow-band semiconductor. The dielectric permittivity values are low,
with the specific surface area of the adsorbent being 161.42 m¬≤/g. The
specific resistance of PCM is higher than MŒ©, and the PCM does not
exhibit capacitance accumulation.

PCM obtained at 600¬∞C shows semiconductor conductivity in the range of
293-343 K, metallic conductivity at 343-393 K, semiconductor again at
393-463 K, and metallic conductivity at 463-483 K. The bandgap width at
293-343 K is 0.87 eV, and at 393-463 K, it is 1.37 eV, classifying it as
a narrow-band semiconductor. The dielectric permittivity values are low,
with the specific surface area of the adsorbent being 150.98 m¬≤/g. The
specific resistance of PCM is higher than MŒ©, and the PCM does not
exhibit capacitance accumulation.

PCM obtained at 700¬∞C exhibits semiconductor conductivity in the range
of 293-353 K, metallic conductivity at 353-363 K, and semiconductor
conductivity again at 363-483 K. The bandgap width of this adsorbent in
the range of 293-353 K is 0.75 eV, and at 363-483 K, ŒîE = 0.86 eV,
classifying it as a narrow-band semiconductor. This adsorbent also
possesses giant dielectric permittivity values: 1.87¬∑10‚Å∑ at 293 K and
1.01¬∑10‚Åπ at 463 K, making this material highly promising for
microcapacitor technology. The specific surface area of the adsorbent is
156.26 m¬≤/g. The specific resistance of PCM is 280-600 Œ©. The
capacitance of PCM is 0.01 ŒºF.

PCM synthesized at 800¬∞C shows metallic conductivity in the range of
293-313 K and semiconductor conductivity in the range of 313-483 K. The
bandgap width in the range of 313-483 K is 0.59 eV, classifying it as a
narrow-band semiconductor, with high dielectric permittivity values
increasing from 1.56¬∑10‚Å∑ (at 293 K) to 6.48¬∑10‚Å∏ (at 453 K). This

specific surface area of the adsorbent is 241.945 m¬≤/g. The specific
resistance of PCM is 250-270 Œ©. The capacitance of PCM is 0.58 ŒºF.

PCM obtained at a higher temperature of 900¬∞C exhibits semiconductor
properties in the range of 293-433 K, and metallic properties at 433-453
K. A second-order phase transition is observed at 433 K. This material
has significantly high dielectric permittivity values: \textasciitilde33
million at 293 K and over one billion (1.12¬∑10‚Åπ) at 483 K. The PCM
sample is of interest both as a semiconductor and as a promising
material for microcapacitor technology. The specific surface area of the
adsorbent is 348.99 m¬≤/g. The specific resistance of PCM is 3-4 Œ©. The
capacitance of PCM is 1.2-1.7 ŒºF.

At high temperatures ranging from 700¬∞C to 900¬∞C, an increase in
dielectric permittivity (Œµ) is observed (Figure 3). The data shows that
PCM obtained at 900¬∞C exhibits giant dielectric permittivity values,
reaching up to 1.12¬∑10‚Åπ at 483 K, making it a highly promising material
for microcapacitor technology. The increase in dielectric permittivity
can be explained by the increase in the specific surface area of PCM, as
the specific capacitance of electrode materials is directly proportional
to the specific surface area. The increase in specific surface area is
due to the carbonization of the raw material in the temperature range of
700-900¬∞C, where heteroatoms are removed, and the structure of flat
aromatic rings develops, forming basic structural units or elementary
graphite crystallites.

Part of the carbon transitions from sp¬≥ to sp¬≤ state, while some is
removed with gaseous and liquid components. Graphenes, consisting of
flat polycyclic aromatic molecules with two-dimensional ordering of
carbon atoms, form in the solid material volume. Steam activation
creates microporous structures by opening pores that are in a closed
state in the carbon material. Based on the analysis of the diagrams
constructed from the experimental data, the following conclusions can be
drawn:

Dielectric Permittivity (Œµ): an increase in the processing temperature
of coal leads to a significant increase in the dielectric permittivity
of the material; the highest level of dielectric permittivity is
achieved at 900 ¬∫C, indicating the potential of the material for
microcapacitor technology. The Œµ value reaches 33 million at 293 K and
exceeds 1 billion at 483 K.

Logarithm of Dielectric Permittivity (lg Œµ): the logarithm of dielectric
permittivity also shows a positive correlation with the processing
temperature, confirming the trend of increasing Œµ with higher
temperatures.

Logarithm of Specific Resistance (lg R): the logarithm of specific
resistance demonstrates an inverse relationship with temperature. As the
processing temperature increases, the specific resistance decreases,
making the material more conductive; materials processed at higher
temperatures (700-900 ¬∫C) show the lowest specific resistance values,
indicating improved conductive properties.

\emph{Comparison of Different Processing Temperatures.} Increasing the
coal processing temperature from 300 ¬∫C to 900 ¬∫C results in significant
changes in its electrical properties. Materials processed at higher
temperatures exhibit better dielectric permittivity and specific
resistance characteristics.The most pronounced changes are observed in
the temperature range of 700-900 ¬∫C, where there is a sharp increase in
Œµ and a decrease in R.

Overall, the conducted studies show that increasing the coal processing
temperature to high values significantly improves its electrical
properties, making the porous carbon material promising for use as
semiconductor and electrode materials in various electrochemical
applications.

To explain the observed changes in types of conductivity in porous
carbon material (PCM) at various temperatures, several factors should be
considered: phase transitions, structural changes in the material, and
alterations in the band structure of the material.

\emph{Phase Transitions.} As the temperature changes, PCM can undergo
several phase transitions that affect its electronic properties. For
example, transitions between metallic and semiconducting states may be
due to changes in the crystalline structure of carbon, such as
transitions from sp¬≤ hybridization (characteristic of graphite) to sp¬≥
hybridization (characteristic of diamond) and vice versa.

\emph{Structural Changes.} When heated to high temperatures (700-900¬∞C),
PCM undergoes the removal of volatile components and restructuring of
the carbon matrix, leading to an increase in specific surface area and
changes in the porous structure. These changes can significantly affect
the material\textquotesingle s electronic conductivity.

\emph{At temperatures of 400-500¬∞C.} An alternation of metallic and
semiconducting conductivity is observed. This can be explained by the
fact that at these temperatures, the carbon structure of the material is
in an intermediate state where different regions can exhibit different
types of conductivity. Metallic regions may be associated with
graphene-like structures, while semiconducting regions are related to
amorphous carbon. Example: at 400¬∞C, the material first exhibits
metallic conductivity and then semiconducting conductivity, which is
related to the restructuring of the carbon matrix with increasing
temperature.

\emph{At temperatures of 500-600¬∞C.} The opposite sequence is observed:
first semiconducting, then metallic conductivity. This may be due to
further changes in the material\textquotesingle s structure, where
larger graphene regions begin to dominate, altering the overall nature
of the conductivity. Example: at 500¬∞C, the material first exhibits
semiconducting conductivity and then metallic conductivity, which may
indicate a phase transition occurring at this temperature.

\emph{At temperatures of 700¬∞C.} Only three changes are observed:
semiconducting, metallic, semiconducting. This indicates stabilization
of the structure, where part of the material has already transitioned
into a stable state with semiconducting properties. Example: at 700¬∞C,
the disappearance of the fourth change may be related to the material
reaching a certain degree of crystallinity, where further phase
transitions become less pronounced {[}22{]}.

\emph{At temperatures of 800¬∞C.} Changes are observed again, but only
twice: first metallic, then semiconducting conductivity. This indicates
a further simplification of the material\textquotesingle s structure,
where large graphene regions dominate. Example: at 800¬∞C, the material
exhibits metallic conductivity, indicating a significant predominance of
graphene-like structures, followed by a transition to a semiconducting
phase with further heating.

\emph{At temperatures of 900¬∞C.} The material changes conductivity
again, but only twice: semiconducting and metallic. This may indicate
the material reaching a state close to a fully ordered graphene
structure with small areas of amorphous carbon. Example: at 900¬∞C, the
material exhibits semiconducting conductivity, followed by metallic
conductivity, indicating the achievement of a certain degree of
crystallinity.

These observations suggest that the structural changes and phase
transitions within PCM at varying temperatures significantly influence
its electrical properties. The alternation between metallic and
semiconducting conductivities is a result of the complex interplay
between the material\textquotesingle s microstructure and its electronic
states, which are temperature-dependent {[}23{]}.

The aforementioned findings are supported by scientific works. For
example, in the scientific article {[}24{]}, the influence of
temperature on the structure and properties of porous carbon materials,
including changes in conductivity, is investigated. In {[}25{]},
structural changes in nanoporous carbon materials at high temperatures
and their impact on electrical conductivity are studied. Reference
{[}26{]} discusses the role of graphitization in altering the electronic
properties of carbon materials, which is relevant to the observed
changes in conductivity. Finally, {[}27{]} examines the effects of
activation on the conductivity and structure of graphene-based
materials.

{\bfseries Conclusions.} Thus, the correlation between conductivity and the
properties of porous carbon materials (PCM) can be observed.

\emph{Electrical Conductivity.} The change in conductivity indicates a
complex internal structure of PCM, where regions with different
electronic properties coexist. These variations impact the overall
electrical conductivity of the material, which is crucial for its
applications in electronics and energy sectors.

\emph{Dielectric Permittivity.} High dielectric permittivity of PCM,
especially at elevated temperatures, indicates the
material\textquotesingle s capability to store electrical energy, making
it promising for use in supercapacitors.

\emph{Specific Surface Area.} An increase in specific surface area with
higher activation temperatures enhances the adsorption properties of the
material, which is beneficial for applications in filters and catalysts.

These dependencies and properties of PCM demonstrate that controlling
the thermal treatment conditions allows for the targeted modification of
its physicochemical properties for optimal use in various technological
processes.

In a carbonized product, crystallites are located in fits and starts,
the spaces between them are filled (or blocked) with amorphous carbon,
which is formed during the separation of resinous substances. When
activated by water vapor, a chemical reaction occurs on the surface of
the pores between water vapor and carbon. As a result of the process, a
very developed pore structure is formed and the internal surface of the
coal increases, as indicated by the results of the study, where the
specific surface area and specific pore volume increase significantly
compared to the untreated sample from 5.11 to 348.99 m¬≤/g, which is
approximately 70 times more due to high temperature activation. SEM
images of PUM show the formation of small nano- and macroparticles of
silicon with a diameter from \textasciitilde{} 50 nm to
\textasciitilde{} 1 Œºm on the surface, which also affects the electrical
properties of the samples. Based on the research findings of the porous
carbonaceous material (CM), several key characteristics have been
investigated for its potential applications as semiconductor and
electrode materials: specific resistance, energy capacity, as well as
electrical resistance and dielectric permeability. It is noteworthy that
increasing the temperature from 300¬∞C to 900¬∞C results in an increase in
dielectric permeability (Œµ) and a decrease in electrical resistance (R)
of the carbonaceous material. Consequently, the CM material shows
promising characteristics for electrode materials: at 293 K, it exhibits
an Œµ value of 33 million, surpassing the benchmark
BaTiO\textsubscript{3} by 25,000 times, and at 483 K (Œµ \textgreater{} 1
billion), exceeding BaTiO\textsubscript{3} by 463,000 times.

Moreover, it should be highlighted that the dielectric permeability of
this relatively inexpensive carbonaceous material can compete with the
similar characteristic of the new La15/8Sr1/8NiO4, which demonstrates a
gigantic dielectric permeability value of 105-106. These findings
demonstrate the prospects for using this product in the electrochemical
industry.
